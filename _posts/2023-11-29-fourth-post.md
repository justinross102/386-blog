As I mentioned in my previous post, I always look forward to trips to a theme park. Most people would agree that the worst part of these trips is always waiting in line. Thus, my goal is to determine the best time to go to a theme park. I have already collected data from during the Morning, Afternoon, and Evening on a Friday and Saturday. This blog post will showcase insightful visualizations made from this data, and will hopefully shed some light on the best time of the weekend to visit a theme park!

# Questions and Visualizations

As we begin an analysis of this data, the first question I have is: which theme park has the most attractions?


    * The visualizations you chose previously along with commentary and insights.
    * A summary of the most intriguing findings from your data and how the EDA
    * A concluding statement.
