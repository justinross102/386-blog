As I mentioned in my previous post, I always look forward to trips to a theme park. Most people would agree that the worst part of these trips is always waiting in line. Thus, my goal is to determine the best time to go to a theme park. I have already collected data from during the Morning, Afternoon, and Evening on a Friday and Saturday. This blog post will showcase insightful visualizations made from this data, and will hopefully shed some light on the best time of the weekend to visit a theme park!

# Questions and Visualizations

As we begin an analysis of this data, the first question I have is: **which theme park has the most attractions?**

From this graph, we see that Cedar Point and Six Flags Great Adventure have significantly more attractions than every other park. Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios from Disney World have the lowest number of attractions. The large difference in attraction counts across parks could be useful for trip planners to know, and future visualizations can help us see how wait times in small (few attractions) parks compare to wait times in large (many attractions) parks.

Another highly important question for theme park visitors is: **What is the difference in ride closures between Friday and Saturday?**
